# dockerfiles

> A collection of dockerfiles to create containers

[Docker](http://docker.io) is an open source project to pack, ship and run any
application as a lightweight container. These *dockerfiles* build containers
that can be run almost anywhere with isolation and repeatability guarentees.


### docker

If you're convinced to use docker already, and __you are using Mac OSX__, you
can simply install using the `install_docker.sh` script. This will install
docker (and all dependencies) into your `~/src/docker` folder and then bring up
the VM. You can clone this repo and run the `install_docker.sh` script:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Nekroze/dockerfiles.git && cd dockerfiles
$ ./install_docker.sh
```

Alternatively, you can cURL and install right away:

```
$ curl https://raw.github.com/Nekroze/dockerfiles/master/install_docker.sh -s | bash
```

Then, you can connect to that VM via:

```
$ cd ~/src/docker
$ vagrant ssh
```

From there, you can install images (`docker pull`) or run images / containers (`docker run`)...

### gitlab-ci-runner

[Gitlab CI](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci) is an awesome project for
continuous integration. We use it to automatically build software as it's
modified through the lifetime of the project. One benefit of Gitlab CI is it
doesn't run the builds on the CI server itself. It allows you to register
*runners* on other machines. All of your developer machines then can register
as runners to run builds.

Documentation to [download and install this image can be found here](gitlab-ci-runner/README.md).
